              The Indian Super League (ISL), kicked off on October 12, 2014 and was recognised as India’s top
                        tier domestic league by FIFA and AFC in October 2019. The league is co-promoted by Reliance,
                        Star India and supported by the All India Football Federation (AIFF). India’s leading
                        industrialists and celebrities from sports as well as the Indian film industry have heavily
                        invested in the league’s 12 clubs based in the following cities: Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Delhi,
                        Goa, Guwahati, Kochi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Jamshedpur.</p>

              <p> The league is committed to investing in stadium refurbishment in the eleven identified venues
                        and also in a strong grassroots development programme that will create a platform to groom
                        football talent in the country. With a mission to revolutionise the sport, the ISL is positioned
                        as a high quality and dynamic league that will elevate Indian football to an international
                        level.</p>
